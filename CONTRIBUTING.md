## üìã Coding Standards

### Java/Kotlin Code Style
- Follow Android's official coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep methods focused and concise

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Video Player**: Modifications should maintain MediaCodec compatibility
- **Audio Player**: Ensure AAC ELD format support is preserved
- **Network**: Follow AirPlay protocol specifications
- **UI**: Maintain Android TV compatibility

### Logging
- Use appropriate log levels:
  - `Log.e()` for errors
  - `Log.w()` for warnings
  - `Log.i()` for important information
  - `Log.d()` for debug information
- Include meaningful context in log messages
- Use consistent TAG naming: `private static final String TAG = "ClassName"`

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test on different Android versions if possible
- Test with various iOS devices and versions
- Verify both audio and video functionality

## üîç Code Review Process

### What We Look For
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance regressions?
- **Compatibility**: Does it work on different Android versions?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean and maintainable?
- **Documentation**: Are changes properly documented?

### Review Timeline
- Initial review: 1-3 days
- Follow-up reviews: 1-2 days
- We may request changes or ask questions

## üéØ Project Areas

### High Priority
- **Audio Processing**: Improvements to AAC ELD decoding
- **Video Optimization**: Reduce latency and improve quality
- **Error Handling**: Better recovery from network/codec errors
- **Performance**: Memory and CPU optimizations

### Medium Priority
- **UI Improvements**: Better user experience
- **Configuration**: User-configurable settings
- **Logging**: Enhanced debugging capabilities
- **Documentation**: Code comments and user guides

### Low Priority
- **Additional Formats**: Support for more audio/video formats
- **Features**: New AirPlay protocol features
- **Tools**: Development and debugging tools

## üìä Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - App starts without crashes
   - Device discovery works
   - Screen mirroring displays correctly
   - Audio plays without issues

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Network disconnection/reconnection
   - App backgrounding/foregrounding
   - Multiple connection attempts
   - Different iOS versions

3. **Performance**:
   - No significant memory leaks
   - Smooth video playback
   - Low audio latency
   - Stable over extended use

### Automated Testing
- Run existing unit tests: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

## üêõ Debugging Tips

### Common Tools
- **ADB Logcat**: `adb logcat -s AacAudioPlayer VideoPlayer MainActivity`
- **Android Studio Profiler**: For memory and CPU analysis
- **Network Tools**: Wireshark for protocol analysis

### Debugging Audio Issues
- Check MediaCodec format support
- Verify AAC ELD codec configuration
- Monitor AudioTrack state
- Check audio data flow through queue

### Debugging Video Issues
- Monitor MediaCodec callbacks
- Check surface state
- Verify H.264 stream format
- Monitor packet queue sizes
